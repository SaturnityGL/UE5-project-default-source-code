turn on word wrap for less headache.
sorry, never used GitHub for this type of thing so I hope it works just fine and the format doesn't get messed up?
For this, I used PVHorror as my project title. For anything saying PVHorror, you will replace with YOUR project file.
Originally, this started as a project literally named MyProject, and I had to rename everything. 

How I rebuilt my broken project after deleting the Source folder, and fixed every compile, module, and toolset error along the way. Everything was broken. I made a C++ actor in a blueprint UE5 project, and somewhere along the way it ruined everything. I couldn't compile, I couldn't build the SLN, I couldn't fix the modules, etc etc etc.
You were happily working in Unreal Engine, maybe designing a level or polishing gameplay, and decided to add a new C++ class while the editor was still open. Unreal hot‚Äëreloaded it, you kept going‚Ä¶ then you closed the editor, came back later, and suddenly your project is broken:
- "The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version" ‚Üí Click Yes ‚Üí
- "Engine modules are out of date and cannot be compiled while the engine is running" ‚Üí Build in IDE ‚Üí
- ‚Ä¶and now nothing works.
You delete the class trying to roll back, but the project still refuses to open, rebuild, or even give you normal VS solution options.
If this sounds like your situation, here‚Äôs the start‚Äëto‚Äëfinish recovery script.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Stop and Back Up
- Close Unreal, Visual Studio, Rider ‚Äî everything.
- Copy your entire project folder somewhere safe as a backup. if something works? Save another copy, backup. Each time. Label them correctly too so you know what works in that backup and what doesnt'

2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the Problem Class Completely
If you deleted the .h and .cpp already, good ‚Äî but make sure:
- No #include "ProblemClass.h" remains in any other .h/.cpp.
- No variables, functions, or UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION references to that class remain.
- Removing class files without cleaning up references will keep breaking your build.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Work ONLY in Your Project Folder
Do not touch engine files under:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_X.X\


Stay inside:
C:\Users\<User>\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyProject\



4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Core Module Structure
Inside Source\ you should have:
Source\MyProject\MyProject.Build.cs
Source\MyProject.Target.cs
Source\MyProjectEditor.Target.cs   (if you have an editor module)



MyProject.Build.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class MyProject : ModuleRules
{
    public MyProject(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore"
        });

        PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            // Add private dependencies if needed
        });
    }
}



MyProject.Target.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyProjectTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
        ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyProject");
    }
}



MyProjectEditor.Target.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectEditorTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyProjectEditorTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Editor;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
        ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyProject");
    }
}



5Ô∏è‚É£ Check .uproject
Open MyProject.uproject in a text editor:
"Modules": [
  {
    "Name": "MyProject",
    "Type": "Runtime",
    "LoadingPhase": "Default"
  }
]


Remove any stale entries for deleted modules.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Clear All Generated Build State
From the project root, delete:
- Binaries
- Intermediate
- .vs
- Saved (optional, clears logs/autosaves)
- The .sln file
This wipes everything Unreal/VS will regenerate.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Regenerate the Solution
- Right‚Äëclick MyProject.uproject ‚Üí Generate Visual Studio project files

8Ô∏è‚É£ Open and Build in Visual Studio
- Open MyProject.sln
- Set:
- Solution Configurations ‚Üí Development Editor
- Solution Platforms ‚Üí Win64
- Build ‚Üí Build Solution
- If it fails instantly: You still have a bad reference to the deleted class ‚Äî fix before proceeding.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Unreal From the .uproject
- Double‚Äëclick MyProject.uproject
- If prompted to rebuild modules, click Yes
- It should now load into the editor

üîü Sanity Check Inside Unreal
- Click Compile in UE toolbar ‚Üí no errors
- Open a simple map ‚Üí Press Play
- No ‚Äúmissing module‚Äù or compile failure pop‚Äëups

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ If All Else Fails ‚Äî Full Module Rename Reset
If Unreal still refuses to open/rebuild, your safest bet is to change the module name entirely so UE treats it like a fresh project.
- Close UE & VS.
- Delete:
- Binaries, Intermediate, .vs, Saved, .sln
- In Source\:
- Rename MyProject folder to a new unique name (e.g. GameFixed)
- Rename MyProjectEditor ‚Üí GameFixedEditor if present
- In each .Build.cs and .Target.cs:
- Update class name to match new module
- Update ExtraModuleNames.Add("GameFixed")
- Edit .uproject "Name" and "Modules" ‚Üí new name
- Update any /Script/MyProject in Config to /Script/GameFixed if they reference your code
- Regenerate solution, build, and launch

Why This Works
Hot‚Äëreload can leave behind:
- Stale compiled DLLs in Binaries
- Mismatched metadata in Intermediate
- .uproject/Config entries pointing to non‚Äëexistent modules
- Stray includes/references to deleted files
Purging generated state and making sure your module definition matches your actual source code forces Unreal to rebuild cleanly.

Pro Tips to Avoid This in Future
- Close Unreal before adding or removing C++ classes ‚Äî build in IDE, then reopen UE
- Use source control ‚Äî one commit before adding code = instant revert if something breaks
- Give your module a unique name (don‚Äôt leave it as MyProject long term)


One thing I would really like to hammer home, I was having non-stop issues. It genuinely kept having error after error, and the one final thing that let everything else work, was renaming the entire project. My project was named MyProject, as I left it as a default. Having it as an actual name helps smoothen a lot of problems.
